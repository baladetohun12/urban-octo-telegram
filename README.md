# Code Refactor Starter Code

For my coding bootcamp class, I was tasked with taking some starter code and making some miniscule edits under the hood. So for this webpage I made the website more accessible, removing redundancies, and adding comments for ease of navigation when reading the HTML & CSS files. I hope that my work doesn't go unnoticed.
